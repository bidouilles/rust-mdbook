# Welcome to Rust 
# (Adapted from Comprehensive Rust) ðŸ¦€

The goal of the course is to teach you Rust. We assume you don't know anything
about Rust and hope to:

* Give you a comprehensive understanding of the Rust syntax and language.
* Enable you to modify existing programs
* Write new programs in Rust for embedded systems
* Show interoperability with C

## Assumptions

The course assumes that you already know how to program. Rust is a statically
typed language and we will sometimes make comparisons with C and C++ to better
explain or contrast the Rust approach.

If you know how to program in a dynamically typed language such as Python or
JavaScript, then you will be able to follow along just fine too.
