# Course Structure

> This page is for the course instructor.

The course is fast paced and covers a lot of ground:

* Course 1: Basic Rust.
* Course 2: Ownership and the borrow checker.
* Course 3: Compound data types,  pattern matching.
* Course 4: The standard library.
* Course 5: Traits and generics, error handling
* Course 6: Testing, unsafe Rust.
* Course 7: Concurrency in Rust and interoperability with other languages

> **Exercise for Day 4:** Do you interface with some C/C++ code in your project
> which we could attempt to move to Rust? The fewer dependencies the better.
> Parsing code would be ideal.

## Format

The course is meant to be very interactive and we recommend letting the
questions drive the exploration of Rust!
